MyToken - A Simple Token Contract

Description:
The MyToken project is a basic implementation of a token contract called MyToken. The contract allows for the creation and management of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functions for minting and burning tokens. The contract keeps track of the total token supply and individual balances for each address.

Getting Started:

Installing:
Since this is a smart contract written in Solidity, there is no need for installation in the traditional sense. You would need to have a development environment with a Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix, Truffle) set up to compile and deploy the contract.

Executing program:
To run the program, follow these steps:

Set up a Solidity development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle).
Create a new Solidity file and name it "MyToken.sol".
Copy and paste the provided code into the "MyToken.sol" file.
Compile the contract using the Solidity compiler.
Deploy the contract to the desired Ethereum network (e.g., local development network, testnet, mainnet).
Note: The execution steps mentioned above assume familiarity with Solidity development and the use of a Solidity development environment.
